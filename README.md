**Project Description**

This project covers the end of Sprints 3-6 & 9. HTML and CSS was heavily implemented for the Sprint 3 project and somewhat less additions were made for Sprint 4-5 projects. Responsive design implementation was applied to optimize the page across different screen sizes, from smartphone all the way to destop. Starting from Sprint 4 javascript was added to make the page more functional and render the buttons functional. Finally APIs where introduced via webpack in Sprint 9 so any changes are saved and preserved even upon page reloading.
