**Project Description**

This project marks the conclusion of TripleTen's Sprint 3. This also concludes Module 1 of the program that spans Sprint 1-3 and covers html and css. Responsive design implementation was applied to optimize the page across different screen sizes, from smartphone all the way to destop.

**Description of technologies and techniques used**

In order to achieve a responsive design a desktop-first approach was used. The page was first set up for desktop screens and in the following phase scaled down to smartphone using media queries defining screen size.

This project also marked the first time the display grid function was used. It was applied in such a way as to scale down the number of columns depending on screen size.
